# esp32-internet-ota

ESP32 + GitHub Actions + Husarnet. 

A boilerplate project for ESP32 allowing in-field firmware update using GitHub Actions workflow.

> **Prerequisites** 
>
> Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [PlatformIO extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode).

## Quick start

### First setup

1. Click **[Use this template](https://github.com/husarnet/esp32-internet-ota/generate)** button to create your own copy of this repo.

2. Clone the repo you have just created and open it in Visual Studio Code. Platformio should automatically install all project dependencies.

3. Rename `credentials-template.h` to `credentials.h` and type your WiFi an Husarnet credentials there (you will find you Husarnet Join Code at https://app.husarnet.com).

4. Click "PlatformIO: upload" button to flash your ESP32 board connected to your laptop. You will find the following log in the serial monitor:

    ```bash
    **************************************
    GitHub Actions OTA example
    **************************************
    
    ðŸ“» 1. Connecting to: FreeWifi Wi-Fi network .. done

    âŒ› 2. Waiting for Husarnet to be ready ... done

    ðŸš€ HTTP server started

    Visit:
    http://my-esp32:8080/

    Known hosts:
    my-laptop (fc94:a4c1:1f22:ab3b:b04a:1a3b:ba15:84bc)
    my-esp32 (fc94:f632:c8d9:d2a6:ad18:ed16:ed7e:9f3f)
    ```

### Internet OTA with GitHub Actions

1. Create the folowing GitHub repository secrets (`Settings` > `Secrets` > `New repository secret`):

    | Secret | Sample Value | Desription |
    | - | - | - |
    | `WIFI_SSID` | FreeWifi | just your WiFi network name |
    | `WIFI_PASS` | hardtoguess | ... and password |
    | `HUSARNET_HOSTNAME` | my-esp32 | hostname under which you want your ESP32 to be available by other peers |
    | `HUSARNET_JOINCODE` | fc94:...:932a/xhfqwPxxxetyCExsSPRPn9 | find your own **secret** Join Code at your user account at https://app/husarnet.com > `choosen network` >  `add element` button. Anyone with this Join Code can connect to your Husarnet network |

2. Push changes to your repo:

    ```bash
    git add *
    git commit -m "triggering the workflow"
    git push
    ```

3. In ~3 minutes the GitHub workflow should finish its job. Visit: `http://my-esp32:8080` URL with a sample "Hello world" website hosted by your ESP32.


    Of course your laptop need to be connected to the same Husarnet network - you will find quick start guide showing how to do it here: https://husarnet.com/docs/


## Tips

### Erasing flash memory of ESP32

1. Connect ESP32 to your laptop

2. Install platformio CLI

    ```bash
    pip install -U platformio
    ```

3. Make flash erase:

    ```bash
    pio run --target erase
    ```

### Monitoring network traffic on `hnet0` interface

```bash
sudo tcpflow -p -c -i hnet0
```

### Accesing a webserver hosted by ESP32 using a public domain

Here is a blog post showing how to configure Nginx Proxy Manager to **provide a public access to web servers hosted by Husarnet connected devices**: https://husarnet.com/blog/reverse-proxy-gui

It can be also used  o provide the access to a web server hosted by ESP32 using a nice looking link like: `https://my-awesome-esp32.mydomain.com`.
